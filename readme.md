### Leveraging Machine Learning for Educational Funding

The crowdfunding platform faces the challenge of efficiently predicting the approval status of
project proposals submitted by teachers. The current manual review process is time-consuming
and may not fully leverage available data. Utilizing past data and critical project attributes, the
task is to build a classification algorithm capable of differentiating between projects with a high
likelihood of approval and those with a high likelihood of rejection.
